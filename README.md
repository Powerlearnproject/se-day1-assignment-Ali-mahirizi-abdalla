#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the process of designing and, developing,modifying and maintaining software systems to solve real word problems.it plays a better role in technology industry by enable the creation of reliable and efficient applicatios that power everything from smartphones to space exploraion. without software engineeing, modern technology like social media platforms and self driving cars would exist, software engieering it is play a major role nowdays.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

stractured programming(1960s)- this introduced breaking code into smaller, managable parts, making it easier tom undersatand and fix. i like how it taught me to write neat and organized code.
object oriented programming (1980s)- oops allowed creating reusable pieces of code, saving time and effort. when i first i used java, i was amazed by how it made coding feel like buliding with bocks.
Agile methodologies(2000s)- Agile focus on teamwork and delivering softwre steps by steps. working in teams, i enjoy how agile helps us adapt quickly and focus on what users need.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

requirement gathering- this is where we figure out what the software needs to do by talking to useres and stalkholders. it is where crativity meets logic, and i can visualize the final product.
Design- is whereby we plan how the software will look and work, creating blueprints or diagrams. i like this phase because it is where crewativity meets logic, and i can visualize the final product.
Implementation- this is actually bulding phase, where developers write the code, it is where ideas comes true in life.
Testing- in this phase we check bugs and ensure the software works properly and efficiently, i like this phase because it is like quality control.
Development- this is where the software released to users. 
Maintainance- after release we fix issues and improve the tthe software based on use feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall- is a linear and stractured, ideal for fixed projects like a bulding a bridge , while Agile- is iterative and flexible perfect for evolving projects like application development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developers- write and maintain the code, turning ideas into functional software.
Quality assuarence engineer- test software to find and fix any bugs.
Project manager- oversee the taem, timelines, and deliverables.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environment(IDEs)-like visual studio making code easier by providing tools for writing, debbugging and testing in one place.
Version Control system- it track changes and collaborate with others, which find teamwork and avoiding code conflicts.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadlins, complex bugs. i can overcome thids challenges by breakig tasks into smaller steps and using debbugging tools to stay focused and efficient.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- checks individual code parts, while Integration testing ensures modules work together.
System testing- validates the whole system.
Acceptance system- onfirms it meet user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

is crafting clear and specific inputs to get the best outputsd from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague promopt- tell me about history
Improved Prompt- Explain the ccauses and effect of world war 2.
i prefer to improved prompt because it is coincise.
